Now you have more information to identify the perpetrator. Peek into the './mystery/vehicles' file. What information does it contain? Cross-reference it with your 'clues.txt' again - is there anything else you could search for in the vehicles record?

############ Challenge ###############

Now you need to search for multiple keywords in one file. How can you combine `grep` with flags and the pipe operator ('|') to filter the vehicle records for:

* car model
* car color
* license plate number
* suspect's height

Save the list of suspects into a new file called 'suspects.txt', commit and push to Github.

You're very happy with the progress of your investigation - you feel like you are close to identifying the culprit. Make a pull request to the original 'clmystery' repository to report your progress to The Chief.

Move on to step 7.

The final outstanding clue is the list of memberships in the wallet found at the crime scene. All that's required now is to verify your suspect holds all of the relevant memberships.

What files does the './mystery/memberships' subdirectory contain? What's inside these files?


############ Challenge ###############

Remember that the `cat` command was originally intended for concatenating files. Using this how can you tell if one suspect has all of the memberships?

How many membership cards were in the wallet? Can you automatically count if the suspect has all of them using `grep`, `wc` commands and the pipe operator?

If you managed to narrow your investigation down to one suspect, read the `solution` file to verify that you have found the killer. Move on to 'step9'

If not, retrace your steps until there is only one suspect.

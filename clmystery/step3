Reference: ./detective_handbook/step3.md

You found 4 matches for the name 'Annabel'. Only 2 of them are women so you can rule out the remainder. Another piece of information you have is their address. There is a 'streets' subdirectory in the 'mystery' directory with a list of files named after streets.

############ Challenge ###############

See if you can find files matching street names for two remaining women named 'Annabel'. Use the combinations of commands from the Detective Handbook (section step3) to do this.

######################################


Take a look inside the files you've found. REMEMBER: among the information available in 'possible_witnesses.txt', you have references to line numbers. See if you can use that line number to discover something useful about the lady called 'Annabel'.

If you get stuck check out hint2.

Move on to step4.

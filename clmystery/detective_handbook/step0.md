# `ls`

The name of the `ls` command stands for "list". If you just type `ls` without arguments the command will list files in the current directory. You can also list files in another directory by calling `ls` with the directory name: `ls mystery/`

# `cd`

`cd` is short for "change directory". Type `cd mystery/` to change current directory to "mystery". To go one level up type `cd ..`. By convention `..` stands for the "parent directory".

# `cat`

`cat FILENAME` is the command you're going to use to view files from the command line. The `cat` command literally means "concatenate" (just a fancy word for "combine") as combining files is its primary purpose, but it is widely used for listing a content of just one file.

# `man`

There will be any number of situations where you'll have a question about what command to use or wonder what a command is truly designed for. Let's see how to handle those situations.

`man ls`

The "man" or "manual" command takes a parameter of another command to provide you more information about it.

Try to use `man` to find out more about `cat`, `ls` and `cd`.

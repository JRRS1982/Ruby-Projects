# `rm`

`rm` is the command for removing files. Type `rm FILENAME` to delete a file permanently. Type `rm -r DIRECTORY_NAME` to remove a directory.

# `git diff`

`git diff` allows you to see changes between any two points in your project. It could be changes between commits, or changes you made since the last commit. Type `git diff` to see the changes since the last commit. Type `git diff COMMIT1..COMMIT2` to see the difference between two commits.

# `git log`

`git log` prints out the commit history in the project. Using `git log` you can find out commit hashes to refer to them later (for example to use them in `git diff`).
